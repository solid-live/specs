      It is common when dealing with groups of Agents to want to create a URI to denote those agents.  This simple spec gives a way to systematically create a group uri given the URIs of the participants.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      It is common when dealing with groups of Agents to want to create a URI to denote those agents.  Yet there is no systematic way to create a URI from a set of its participatns.  This simple spec solves the problem by creating a FOAF Group with members the URIs, canonicalizing it, taking the hash, and then creating a URI from that hash.

        <h3>Read Write Web Community Group</h3>

        Groupuris is one of several related specifications being discussed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">W3C Read Write Web
          Community Group</a>.
        </section>


        <section>
          <h3>Overview</h3>

          First we will create a FOAF group from the participants.  Then we will canonicalize it, then we will take a hash, to create a URI.

        <section>
          <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

          The ontology / vocabulary used is the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> vocabulary.

        <h2>Creating a Group</h2>

        Groups are simply a FOAF Group with members that are the URIs in that Group.  Initially a bnode is used as a temporary identifier.


        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>

          <pre class="turtle">
            [] a foaf:Group ;
            foaf:member &lt;http://example.org/alice#me&gt; ;
            foaf:member &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; .
          </pre>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Canonicalization</h2>

        <p>It is useful to canonicalize the group before taking a hash so that the same participants independently hashed will yield the same URI.</p>

        <p>The canonicalization follows typical RDF patterns and consists of creating ntriples, one per line, which are sorted alphabetically.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Example</h3>


          <pre class="turtle">
_: &lt;https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Group&gt; .
_: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/member&gt; &lt;http://example.org/alice#me&gt; .
_: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/member&gt; &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; .
          </pre>
        </section>
      </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Hashing</h2>

            <p>For convenience is it often useful to hash the normalized RDF into a short hash.  Suggested is sha256 for this to create an ni:/// hash as per RFC 6920.</p>

            <section>
              <h3>Example</h3>

              <pre class="">
                ni:///sha256;uGRJJ8M9AW9ne_pZOc4qJ1ZJOwHd8nMEV1b7FXE3YUQ
              </pre>
